## Realisation

      -Object Oriented Programming rules
      -SOLID Principals

      TypeScript
      
      JS Class
      All of the manipulation with the Task goes VIA CLASS METHODS.
      Delete item itself(!) via the class instance method. It's unnecessary for a simple project but critical helpful
      for a real big project with complex JS logic.
      
      Holding the click Event from several targets by only the one EventListeners. (itemHolderForDelete)
      Pick up the TaskInstanse and hold them WITHOUT using eny of an iteration circle.
