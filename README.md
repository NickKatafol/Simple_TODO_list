#### ES6 Class

All of the manipulations with the Task goes VIA CLASS METHODS.
Delete the Task item itself via the class instance method. 
It's unnecessary for a simple project but critical helpful 
for a real big project with a complex JS logic.

#### EventListeners
Holding the click Event from several targets by only the one EventListeners (itemHolderForDelete)

Adding the Task by hiting the Enter.

Pick up the TaskInstanse and hold them WITHOUT using eny of 
an iteration circle.

Validation the typing text agenst the empty string.
